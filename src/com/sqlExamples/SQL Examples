1 ---- Important SQL queries
       1. Return employee record with Highest salary from employee table
          Select *
          From employee
          where Salary = (select max(salary) from employee)

       2. Select Highest salary from employee table
          Select max(salary)
          From employee

       3. Select 2nd Highest salary from employee table
          Select max(Salary)
          From employee
          Where salary not in (select max(salary) from employee)

       4. Return employee name , highest salary and department
          Select e.firstName, e.lastName, e.Salary, d.department
          From Employee e
          Inner Join Department d ON
          e.department = d.department




2 ---- Inner Join : This selects all rows from both the tables for given condition.
       Syntax : Select t1.col1,t1.col2,t2.col1,t2.col2
                From t1
                JOIN t2 On
                t1.col1 = t2.col2

       Example : SELECT city, country
                 FROM city
                 INNER JOIN country ON
                 city.country_id = country.country_id;


3 ---- WHERE vs HAVING

       Select *
       From t1
       where <filter condition>
       group by <colum list>
       having <filter on aggregate column>

       SELECT NAME, SUM(SALARY) FROM Employee
       GROUP BY NAME
       HAVING SUM(SALARY)>3000;

       a. HAVING clause works a a filter on top of grouped rows returned by the GROUPBY clause

       b. WHERE condition works on individual rows, where as HAVING applys the filter condition at grouped rows.
